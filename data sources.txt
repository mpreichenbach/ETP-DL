	The dataset consists of aerial imagery of Dubai obtained by MBRSC satellites and annotated with pixel-wise semantic segmentation in 6 classes. The total volume of the dataset is 72 images grouped into 6 larger tiles. The classes are:

    	Building: #3C1098
    	Land (unpaved area): #8429F6
    	Road: #6EC1E4
    	Vegetation: #FEDD3A
